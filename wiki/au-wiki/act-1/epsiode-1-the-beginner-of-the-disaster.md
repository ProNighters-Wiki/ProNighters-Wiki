life of their server. They gave admin Powers to someone untrusted and then.. kaboom! The server was in a total disaster. but, this person didn't stop\
He also destroyed the center of discord, making the universe unstable, but why? We don't know. But the only thing that can make the universe to don't go into collapse… It was the center of the universe called: "Universe Works" Or "Centrum Universi" with only touch it… It can save the universe and make it stable again but…\
Any that touches the center of the universe… the person did touch it… needs to sacrifice themselves if they want the universe to survive, and someone to survive.

Did any of our héroes make it? We don't know… for now.

Everyone knows about this disaster, and how did affect too much to the universe, so, everyone on their own, has to survive… But today isn't normal...\
Someone called "Mechanized" \[ Mecha ] Did save one person called "Moth" \[ Falena K. Bombyxmori] and they got into the safe zone, or the "safe zone" has Mecha into\
"Hey, are you fine?" Said Mecha with worried eyes and having them paint gun in their back - "Yes, I am fine, totally fine." - Moth said with tired eyes and a tired face - "I am Mecha, and you?" - "I am Falena K. Bombyxmori, But You can just call me Moth." - The two got quickly a strong friendship, and Moth told mecha he was a leader about these Little humans left, but he needed to find all of them before it too late, mecha asked why? - "There a creature coming over there killing people thinking is food, I don't know he or she I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THAT CREATURE! But… that… can kill everyone when or not is their way." - Said Moth with almost worry and anger at the same time - "But I know who brings the food" - "Who?" - asked Mecha... - "Fall Or they call it hab clan... He looks offensive, but he brings any human dead or alive to that creature. Don't get fooled by his appearance or personality He doesn't care about you." - Said Moth with determination, like he was telling a history to a new friend. - "So what we do now?" - "We need to survive, find loot, Find anything we need, and then leave, our only opportunity is to get the Centrum Universi" - Said Moth… but this is don't gonna be easy.

As they lead the way, to search for loot in the destroyed server until… - "HIDE!" - Moth throws Mecha into the floor. - "HEY! Why was that?!" - "Here they come..." Boris and Fall were close to them… Boris was angry, and them was having very sharp teeth, that teeth could kill any person or robot. - "Hey, don't worry, I Will find food for you - Said Fall with an evil face, Moth and Mecha hid trying to not make any noise to notice Boris or Fall, Until… Boris sniffed the place\
Where they are hiding, until… BITE! But they missed, don't able to touch mecha or moth. "That was close" - Mecha spoke, until Boris noticed and BITE! Bitting mecha. But\
